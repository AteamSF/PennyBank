As a college student at the age of early 20's I want to have fun and enjoy my early 20s. The majority of students don't think of retirement until later in life. There are two basic problems here:

* Wasting time in things and situation that do not matter for future security
* Building a spending habit and most likely getting your self in dept.

Things that most students or teens don't really like or prefer doing:
* Paperwork
* Time
* Trips to the bank
* Learn things that our not in their interest

PennyBank will monitor all your transactions and take the cent amount and round them to the nearest dollar. PennyBank will take that change and invest it into a 401k for you or any investment options that we have in our system. 

You are not limited to these two options, but you can create a wishlist and we will setup a cents investment into it. In no time you can become a lot more richer and save a lot of money without even knowing. All this is done in back-end without the user having to go through the boring paperwork.
